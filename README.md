# BasicNoaServer
 For the Brilliant Labs Frame Glasses - a basic python handler for requests from the app.


 can expose via ngrock if wanted, but that is beyond the scope of how this was used/set up for beyond the basic tests. 

On the local network the server should be exposed (and tell you the server/port)

 put that into the app as http://< ip >:< port > and it should work.  I just set no as the api key and such, and it worked for the basic tests this was used for.


 Not much help can/will be given for this, as it is a one-off to merge into larger projects.

Probably needs to have flask, speech_recognition, abstractmethod (abc), and requests installed.  I think that is all that is needed that isn't in default python.
